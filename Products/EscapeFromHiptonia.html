            <strong>Description</strong>
            <p>Escape From Hiptonia was created to test the concept of a survival RTS<br/>
                game. The idea is that you crashed on a planet after having your ship<br/>
                sabotaged by the oppressive hipsters who have taken over the global government<br/>
                and is forcing everything man, woman, and child to wear neck beards.</p>
            <strong>Game Play</strong>
            <p>The game is started with one harvester and enough resources for<br/>
                two turrets. Harvest more resources by left clicking on the harvester<br/>
                and right clicking on the node to harvest from, the little blue squares.<br/>
                The harvester will go back and forth harvesting and delivering its resources.<br/>
                Once the resource is spent, the harvester will sit at the base until another<br/>
                resource is selected. Turrets are placed by clicking on the turret button just<br/>
                below the score and wave counters. Once you have enough resources, the<br/>
                button will show up again allowing you to place additional turrets. Enemies<br/>
                are spawned after each wave is defeated, and each wave contains an additional<br/>
                number of enemies. The enemies will attack the nearest resource, turret, base,<br/>
                or harvester until it is destroyed.</p>
            <strong>Scoring</strong>
            <p>Defeat as many enemies and enemy waves as you can. With the games current<br/>
                settings, the highest wave I have been able to get to is 8.<br/></p>
