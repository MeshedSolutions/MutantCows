            <p>Before I go much further developing Toast, I decided it was time to take time to clean up and refactor
            the game code before adding any additional complexity, such as the tactics engine. What this allows me to
            do is clean up the code by removing unused methods, variables, properties and such that get created and
            abandoned while testing ways of doing things.
            </p>

            <p>
                Refactoring is simply the organization of code to make it easier to read, understand, and maintain. By
                providing relevant names to variables and methods that describe what it is used for or what it does, the
                ability to read and follow what the code is doing is dramatically increased, especially for those who didn't
                write the code. Taking methods with multiple chunks of logic or behavior and putting those chunks into
                well named methods of their own is another important refactoring technique. Here is an example before and
                after of one of the files I refactored.
            </p>

            <p>

                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6">

                    </div>
                </div>
            </p>

            <p>
                The third most common refactoring technique I employee is creating service classes from the code. A service
                class is created and used to handle item or tasks specific actions, such as getting all, checking health,
                creating a new item, getting the total count of created items, and other such actions that would be used
                anywhere in the game. The service provides a way to centralize the code instead of potentially having
                multiple ways of doing the same thing in different parts of the game code. Even if the methods in the
                service are only used in say one class file, it is still easier to find all of the methods for the item,
                such as a monster, instead of having to find this code and logic buried in methods. Here is an example
                of a the service class I created to handle generic monster tasks and queries.
            </p>

                </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The final thing I like to do is expose certain variables to the Unity UI. This is incredibly useful for
                tweaking values when adjusting game play and balance, and can be done while the game is running in Unity
                instead of requiring the developer to update the variable value in code and relaunch the game to see its
                effect. You can see in the image below that I have exposed the ChanceToDodge variable to the UI, which is
                then displayed as Chance To Dodge and has the initial value I assigned in the Damage Manager class file.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                Now that I have completed the refactoring, I am feeling much better about starting the work on the tactics
                engine which while it will start out with simple logic, I expect the complexity to grow very quickly.

            <p>For this phase I am working on what I consider to be the most important part of this game, the tactics
            system. The tactics system is what will differentiate your team from everyone else's and defines the actions
            your team does in a fight. The tactics system is basically a rules engine that is used to determine what actions
            occur and to whom based on certain criteria.</p>

            <p>Two of the best examples of this is in Final Fantasy 12 and in Dragon Age: Origins. In Final Fantasy 12,
            you have a team of three. You control the movements and combat choices for one of the characters while the
            other two are on auto pilot using the rules you define for each one. In Dragon Age: Origins, you have a
            team of up to four characters and you can define the rules for all of the characters. You control the actions
            of only one of the characters at a time, but you can switch between any of them most of the time while
            the others use the rules you define for their formation, movements, and actions.</p>

            <p>It took me a while to wrap my head around how I wanted to handle this, and especially in a way that
            would allow the ability to handle a large combination of rules without a lot of code repetition and would
            make it easy to add additional actions and conditions, or at least some sort of standard way of adding them.
            I finally realized that I needed to step back and really define what it was I was trying to do.</p>

            <p>

                </a>
            </p>

            <p>The notes above, yes I know you probably can't read my writing, helped me solidify the logic for the rule
            engine itself. Next I tried to figure out how I could work this programmatically. I possibly over engineered
            this a little bit, but I just can't think of another way to handle multiple items in a similar and predictable
            fashion.</p>

            <p><strong>Warning: I am going to discuss some more complicated programing concepts called design patterns to describe
            how I intend to implement the rules engine.</strong> So my thought is to include the name of a class for each of
            the values used as the target, condition, and action. This class name would be used with a factory using the
            class name as the flag. I would then use reflection to create an instance of that class, such as "AnyTeamMember"
            as the class for a target, and return that class. Each of these classes would conform to one of three interfaces
            that is used to define the three types of classes, target, condition, and action. Using the interface, I will
            use a strategy method to call the methods on the class returned. This would allow me to hide the implementation
            details for each class, provide a standard set of method that have to be included, and allow me to predictably
            handle each class. This opens it up to allow me to create any number of classes for each type that each do
            their own thing, and also provides a way for the player to build any combination of strategies without adding
            and additional line of code. So by using Interfaces, the Factory Pattern, the Strategy Pattern, and reflection
            I can follow the logic from the third page to handle each rule in turn.</p>

            <p>I would love input on this, I am very curious to see how other people have done this or if I am blatently
            overlooking anything.</p>

            <p>I also updated the development document to show the current progress and add some of the goals for the
            fifth phase. Over the next week as I implement the tactics system, I will be adding additional phases and
            reviewing the existing phases to make sure each phase includes a nice chunk of progress but not so much to
            take over a week or two or be over whelming. The development document can be found

            <p>Just a quick update for now. While I am still making progress on the tactics system, or rules engine, I
            was showing my work to the family over the weekend and noticed that the Game Over label wasn't anchored
            properly. This meant that instead of keeping the label just above the Start and Main Menu buttons as I planned,
            its position would move up and down freely with different resolutions. In my case, this made it virtually
            impossible to click the Start button. This is fixed and I have updated the builds with this change.</p>

            <p>Today I finished the arena waves, wrapping up the second phase. Now the game tracks what wave you are in,
                and for each wave, the number of monsters is increased up to a max of four per wave. No screen shots this
                time, I have created a Windows and Mac build to check out instead.</p>

            <p>Up next, the start of the next phase, is the creation of the tactics system. This is what will allow
                customized party member actions and really make the game fun and more strategic. I will be doing quite a bit
                of code cleanup and refactoring during this phase as well.</p>

            <p>Wrapped up the first phase last night and started on the second phase today. In order to build the team
                of four and have waves of enemies, I had to make the fight engine and UI code modular. I ended up wrapping
                all of the code and UI labels into one fighter prefab. Now I can add as many fighters, monsters, or enemies
                as I want and they will all work the same. I also have all fighters, the term used for fighters, monsters,
                and anything else that fights, randomly targeting a member of the opposing team before each attack.</p>

            <p>Next up are the status labels which will indicate each fighter's current action as well as damage taken
                or whether an attack is dodged. I am really excited about building the enemy waves though so I might just
                do that first. Once I have the enemy waves done, I will throw together and post a build, though it won't
                be too much fun until after the tactics are put in place.</p>

            <p>For now, here are some screen shots of the current progress. Bonus screen shot of some of the code that
                is badly in need of refactoring.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of things that have been done so far to include
            as updates so this will be a big one.</p>

            <p>So first things first, I have created a very light
            development plan for the game. So far I have detailed the progression
            of the games development through the first four phases.</p>

            <p>I used paper and pen to map out and create a development strategy for the first phase. I will warn you
            now, even I find it interesting to read my own hand writing.</p>

            <p>I am using <a href="http://meatgrinder.meshedsolutions.com">Meat Grinder</a>
            to plan out how to do the first phase. I like Meat Grinder for two reasons. First, I built it :), and
            second, I like to plan my work backwards, from completed project back to the first tasks, which Meat grinder
            was made for.</p>

            <p>To wrap things up, I got some great assets from Mitch to use as avatars for the fighters and monsters as
                well as a background for the arena</p>
